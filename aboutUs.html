            <p id = "anthonyText">Hi, I'm Anthony Cunningham. Before I decided to switch careers, I was in the Army serving as an Infantryman. I decided to learn Software Development because I wanted to do something that has global impact and can make a difference. I wanted to be able to create things and do something new. <br><br>
            I picked this specific skill because I wanted to learn a new skill. Being in the Army, I was taught skills, but they do not translate well into anything useful in the normal world. I wanted to do something that would allow me to keep learning and keep developing. <br><br>
            The ideal environment in which I would like to use these skills is preferably in environment where I can work on the future. I.E, A laboratory, working on augmentations for amputees who need mechanical limbs; Or working in a gaming studio building entertainment for people to enjoy.<br><br>
            A past experience that makes me a better developer is being able to mentor others and have persistence. Building others up to do their best is an invaluable skill to bring to any team, and one I am proud to say I have.</p><br>

            <p id = "sueText">Hi, I'm Dr. Sue Tarazi, Physical Therapist and Specialist in Orthopedics. I owned and operated my Physical Therapy Private Practice for over 9 years that operated in the black every year. After getting burned out in a career providing healthcare to others, I decided to make the transition to software development. Many years ago I was a dot.commer and am excited to find my way back to the tech industry. <br><br> 
            I still love health and wellness as well as caring for others, but being in tech actually allows me to work with a team on a product or service that can help people on a larger scale.<br><br>
            I still bring with me the skills of organizing and running a project, excellent problem solving skills, connecting with others and making them feel important as well as my lifelong love of learning.
